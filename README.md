# Dataset

The dataset used is Churn_Modelling.csv, which contains customer information, including:
- Demographics: Geography, Gender, Age
- Financial Information: Balance, Credit Score, Estimated Salary
- Banking Activity: Number of Products, Tenure, Credit Card, Active Member
- Target Variable: Exited (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

#  Data Preprocessing:
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps:
### Dropping Unnecessary Columns: 
Customer ID and name are removed as they donâ€™t contribute to predictions.
### Encoding Categorical Variables:
 - Label Encoding for Gender converts text values into numerical ones.
 - One-Hot Encoding for Geography ensures categorical values are represented properly.
### Feature Scaling: 
Standardizing numerical values improves model performance.
### Saving Encoders & Scalers: 
These preprocessing components are stored for consistent input transformation during predictions.

# Model Training with ANN
The ANN model consists of:
### Input Layer: 
Takes in customer details like age, balance, and tenure.
### Hidden Layers: 
Utilize ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns.
### Output Layer: 
Uses Sigmoid activation to predict the probability of customer churn.
### The model is trained with:
- Adam optimizer : Efficiently adjusts learning rates for faster convergence.
- Binary cross-entropy loss : Suitable for binary classification problems.
- Early Stopping & TensorBoard Logging : Prevents overfitting and allows real-time monitoring.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV, which systematically tests different configurations of:
- Number of neurons per layer
- Number of hidden layers
- Number of epochs
This optimization ensures the model is fine-tuned for the best accuracy and efficiency.

# Monitoring & Visualization with TensorBoard
To track training performance, TensorBoard is used for real-time visualization and diagnostics. It helps analyze:

### Key Metrics Tracked:

### 1. Bias Histogram:
Displays weight distributions across network layers, ensuring stable learning.
### 2.Epoch Accuracy:
Measures the accuracy improvement over training epochs.
### 3. Epoch Loss: 
Shows how effectively the model minimizes errors.
### 4. Evaluation Accuracy vs. Iterations: 
Compares accuracy across training and validation data.

### Sample TensorBoard Visualizations:
The following visualizations illustrate different aspects of training:
 - Helps in diagnosing model stability and weight distributions.
 - Shows accuracy trends over time, ensuring model is learning properly.
 - Helps in understanding performance differences between training and validation data.

TensorBoard is a crucial tool for detecting overfitting, learning rate issues, and model convergence.

To launch TensorBoard:

```bash
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
```

# Making Predictions
Once trained, the model can predict customer churn based on new user inputs. The prediction process involves:
### 1. Loading Pre-trained Model & Encoders: 
The trained ANN and saved encoders ensure consistency.
### 2.Preprocessing User Input: 
Inputs are encoded and scaled similarly to the training phase.
### 3.Running Prediction: 
The model computes churn probability.
### 4.Interpreting Results:
 - If Churn Probability > 0.5 â†’ Customer is likely to churn.
 - Otherwise â†’ Customer is likely to stay.

# Running the Streamlit App

The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing a web interface for predictions. To launch:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Users can input customer details and instantly get churn predictions through a user-friendly dashboard.

# Conclusion

This project provides an end-to-end AI-powered solution for predicting customer churn. By integrating data preprocessing, ANN training, hyperparameter tuning, and real-time monitoring with TensorBoard, the model offers a scalable, efficient approach to understanding and mitigating customer attrition.
