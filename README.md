# Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN and Streamlit
## Overview

This project builds a deep learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict customer churn. The model analyzes customer attributes like age, credit score, account balance, and transaction behavior to determine the likelihood of churn.

It involves:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing data.

Model Training – Building and training an ANN model.

Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing the model for better performance.

Monitoring & Visualization – Using TensorBoard for real-time tracking.

Prediction & Deployment – Using the model in a Streamlit web app.
